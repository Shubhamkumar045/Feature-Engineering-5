    "Q1. What is the difference between Ordinal Encoding and Label Encoding? Provide an example of when you\n",
    "might choose one over the other.\n",
    "Answer--Ordinal encoding and label encoding are both techniques used to convert categorical variables \n",
    "into numerical format, but they differ in their application and purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "Label Encoding:\n",
    "\n",
    "Label encoding assigns a unique integer value to each category in a categorical variable.\n",
    "The assigned integers are arbitrary and don't carry any inherent order or meaning.\n",
    "It's typically used for categorical variables where there is no ordinal relationship among the categories.\n",
    "Examples include encoding categorical variables like \"red\", \"green\", and \"blue\" as 0, 1, and 2, respectively.\n",
    "Ordinal Encoding:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinal encoding also converts categorical variables into numerical format, but it assigns integers based\n",
    "on the ordinal relationship among the categories.\n",
    "The assigned integers have a specific order that reflects the natural ordering of the categories.\n",
    "It's used when there is a clear ordering or ranking among the categories.\n",
    "Examples include encoding categorical variables like \"low\", \"medium\", and \"high\" as 0, 1, and 2, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. Explain how Target Guided Ordinal Encoding works and provide an example of when you might use it in\n",
    "a machine learning project.\n",
    "Answer--Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is a technique used to encode categorical variables based on the\n",
    "target variable's mean or median value within each category. It is particularly useful when dealing with \n",
    "categorical variables with a large number of categories and when there is a significant relationship \n",
    "between the categorical variable and the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how Target Guided Ordinal Encoding works:\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculate the Mean or Median Target Value: For each category in the categorical variable, calculate\n",
    "the mean or median of the target variable (e.g., binary classification label) for observations\n",
    "belonging to that category.\n",
    "\n",
    "Order Categories by Target Mean or Median: Order the categories based on their corresponding mean\n",
    "or median target value. Categories with higher mean or median target values are assigned higher ranks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assign Ordinal Labels: Assign ordinal labels (integers) to the categories based on their rank order. \n",
    "The category with the highest mean or median target value is assigned the highest label, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encode the Categorical Variable: Replace the categories with their corresponding ordinal labels in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. Define covariance and explain why it is important in statistical analysis. How is covariance calculated?\n",
    "Answer--Covariance is a statistical measure that quantifies the degree to which two random variables\n",
    "change together. In other words, it measures the extent to which changes in one variable correspond\n",
    "to changes in another variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's why covariance is important in statistical analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "Relationship between Variables: Covariance provides insight into the direction of the relationship \n",
    "between two variables. A positive covariance indicates that the variables tend to move in the same\n",
    "direction (i.e., when one variable increases, the other variable also tends to increase), while a \n",
    "negative covariance indicates an inverse relationship (i.e., when one variable increases, the other tends to decrease).\n",
    "\n",
    "Strength of Relationship: The magnitude of the covariance indicates the strength of the relationship \n",
    "between the variables. Larger absolute values of covariance suggest a stronger relationship between \n",
    "the variables, while values closer to zero indicate a weaker relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use in Linear Regression: Covariance plays a crucial role in linear regression analysis, where it\n",
    "is used to estimate the slope of the regression line and assess the relationship between the \n",
    "independent and dependent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. For a dataset with the following categorical variables: Color (red, green, blue), Size (small, medium,\n",
    "large), and Material (wood, metal, plastic), perform label encoding using Python's scikit-learn library.\n",
    "Show your code and explain the output.\n",

    "variables, including \"Gender\" (Male/Female), \"Education Level\" (High School/Bachelor's/Master's/PhD),\n",
    "and \"Employment Status\" (Unemployed/Part-Time/Full-Time). Which encoding method would you use for\n",
    "each variable, and why?\n",
    "Answer--For the categorical variables \"Gender,\" \"Education Level,\" and \"Employment Status,\"\n",
    "the choice of encoding method depends on the nature of the variables and the requirements of\n",

    "\n",
    "Gender (Binary Variable: Male/Female):\n",
    "\n",
    "Since \"Gender\" is a binary variable with no inherent order, I would use label encoding.\n",
    "Label encoding assigns integer values (0 and 1) to represent the categories.\n",
    "In this case, Male might be encoded as 0 and Female as 1 or vice versa.\n",
    "Education Level (Ordinal Variable: High School/Bachelor's/Master's/PhD):\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Education Level\" is an ordinal variable with a clear order or hierarchy among the categories.\n",
    "Therefore, I would use ordinal encoding for this variable.\n",
    "Ordinal encoding assigns integer values based on the ordinal relationship between the categories.\n",
    "For example, High School could be encoded as 0, Bachelor's as 1, Master's as 2, and PhD as 3.\n",
    "Employment Status (Nominal Variable: Unemployed/Part-Time/Full-Time):\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Employment Status\" is a nominal variable with categories having no intrinsic order or hierarchy.\n",
    "For nominal variables, one-hot encoding is typically preferred.\n",
    "One-hot encoding creates binary (0 or 1) dummy variables for each category.\n",
    "For example, Unemployed might be represented as [1, 0, 0], Part-Time as [0, 1, 0], and Full-Time as [0, 0, 1].\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. You are analyzing a dataset with two continuous variables, \"Temperature\" and \"Humidity\", and two\n",
